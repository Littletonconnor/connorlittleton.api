# Connorlittleton.api

## Overview
Welcome to connorlittleton.api! A simple jsonplaceholder alternative using my own API, a custom docs site, CICD pipeline, etc.

## Folder Structure

### Terraform
This directory contains a Terraform module to deploy the API on an EC2 instance. At one point I had the EC2 instance configured with a docs site and API but I removed it. Checkout my [blog post](https://www.connorlittleton.dev/posts/deploying-an-api) on how I configured it though.

### apps/www
This is an un-finished nextra site, but demonstrates how you can easily setup documentation around your API.

### apps/api
This is the meat of the project, this is where the API lives!
